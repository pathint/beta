# Beta distribution model of the within-sample relative expression orderings (REOs)

## Step 1
Prepare a sample of expression profiles and save it in a matrix form, m x n, where m is the sample size and n is the genome size;

## Step 2
Run the Julia code "reo_stat.jl" to calculate the distribution of the proportions of the major REO patterns among all gene pairs.

## Step 3
Run the Mathematica code "beta_fit.m" to do a manual fitting on the distribution of the REO patterns.
